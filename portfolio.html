      <p>This landing page for The Creative State License Plate, was redisigned in
        2018 because the conversion rate was very low.</p>
      <p>Working with graphic designer, Andie Freeman, we used elements from the previous
        design by Clean, Inc.  This redesigned site has a clearer call to action and moves
        the information about Arts North Carolina, below the fold.  I also made use of CSS
        grid to create a seamless transition from desktop to mobile.</p>
      <p>As a result of this redesign, our conversion rate increased from .23% to 4.46%, an approx. 1800% increase.</p>

    <div class="proText">
      <p>This site was originally created as a companion mobile site to Arts North Carolina's annual ARTS Day event.
      It was recently updated to serve as a year round advocacy site. The site uses jQuery Mobile and is branded with ARTS Day and
      Arts North Carolina colors and logos.</p>
      <p>From this site, users can get information about the schedule and parking for ARTS Day and connect with other attendees
        through social media.  They can also find information about Arts North Carolina's legislative agenda, the NC General
        Assembly, and they can report the results of their legislative visits.</p>

    the Comprehensive Arts Education State site on a computer monitor and phone" /></figure>
  <div class="proText">
    <p>This site was created as a result of a partnership between Arts North Carolina, the NC Arts Council and the NC Department
      of Public instruction and financed through a grant from Americans for the Arts. Clean Inc. created the design and I served
      as the web developer for the project.</p>
    <p>Through the site, the user can read about Comprehensive Arts Education and its benefits and get connected to the organizations
      in the partnership. An animated image serves as a section menu for the "Three Part Plan".  This was accomplished through animating an SVG
      image with JavaScript.</p>
